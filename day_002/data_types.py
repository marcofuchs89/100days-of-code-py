# String
# Individual characters in quotation marks are called a "String"
# We can subscript a string, to retrieve a individual character at a given position
# e.g. retrieve the second character of the word 'Hello' by accessing it at Index of 1 (Programmers start counting at 0)
print("Hello"[1])
# We can also retrieve the last character in two possible ways
# Counting to the last index and using it's value
print("Hello"[4])
# or using the special Index -1 to get the last character
print("Hello"[-1])

# Integer
# Numbers without decimal places
print(123 + 345)
# Large Integers 
# We can add underscores to represent seperators
# The underscores will be ignored by the interpreter
print(123_456_789)

# Float
# Numbers with decimal places
print(3.141592654)

# Boolean
# Can only hold two Values - True and False
print(True)
print(False)
