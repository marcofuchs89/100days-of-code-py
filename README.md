# 100days-of-code-py

This repository helps me to keep track of my working files which are needed for the 100 Days of Code (Python) Challenge/Course by Dr. Angela Yu on her [Website](https://100daysofpython.dev/).

## Outline

The Course is outlined on a daily basis, where you'll have a lesson/code in python for 1 hour a day, repeated for 100 days, to get a good grasp at Python!

The Repository will follow a similar Structure with branches:

- development (default branch)
- main (stable release branch)
- day-x-wip (current branch for the lectures)
